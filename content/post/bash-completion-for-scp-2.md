I have been looking for a solution for broken bash_completion for scp command. I was thinking my ssh was not configured correctly for password-less login. But I just found out that bash completion is broken for Ubuntu 9.10.

If you are suffering from same symptom, please read [this article](http://pro.grammatic.org/post-fixing-scp-completion-in-ubuntu-910-73.aspx) for fix.
